# HTMLRunner
HTMLRunner Python 3.0+ Code

HTMLTestRunner is a tool for getting nice, presentable HTML reports while running Selenium tests using PyUnit.

HTMLRunner was based on Python 2.0, so it was not being used for Python 3.0+ tests.

Now I have ported the code to Python 3.0+ compatible format.
